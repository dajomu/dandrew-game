A game that me and Andrew are making

We'll add a prototype twine game in here for now, where can start to structure things and add dialogue, etc...

I've added a prototype game created in RPG Maker VX Ace.
I also downloaded two asset packs -
- POP! Horror City
- Futuristic Tiles Resource Pack

I downloaded them as dlc on steam, here's how -
1. Go to the purchases page (click your name in the top right and select purchases) on humble bundle (once you've logged in)
2. Go to the RPG Maker purchase page
3. Click `Reveal your steam key` for RPG Maker VX Ace and the two dlc packs I mentioned above
4. Open Steam, log in
5. In the Steam top menu select `Games > Activate a Product on Steam...`
6. Click `Next`, `I agree`, then post the VX Ace steam key in the text box and redeem, do this for the two asset packs too
7. Once they have downloaded open RPG Maker VX Ace from within the steam `Library > Software`
8. Click `Open Project`, then navigate to `github folder > dandrew-game > RPGMakerVX > StarterProject`, then load `Game.rvproj2`. You should see a little guy in a blue square on some light blue tiles. That's as far as I've got for now.
9. We can go over importing resources later, or you can just check this out - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=131363913 - you'll need to import assets through `Tools > Resource Manager...`. I haven't added any resources from the packs yet.
